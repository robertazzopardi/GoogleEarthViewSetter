# GoogleEarthViewerSwift
A small tool that sets the desktop background to a Google Earth Image

With inspiration from the https://earthview.withgoogle.com extension this swift application:
  - Selects a random image from the linked page and sets the desktop background to that image
      Note: This only works when on the Desktop Space and not in any full screen application or space (sets the background of that space and not every space available)
  - Creates a storage folder in the Pictures Directory 
      Makes a log of urls to all previously set backgrounds
      Saves the previous 10 images and maintains a 10 back log
